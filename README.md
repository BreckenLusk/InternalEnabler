## Description
This is a script which will enable certain internal features on production builds of iOS. This *does not* install the Internal Settings bundle that comes pre-installed on InternalUI builds, but rather enables certain features such as Tap-to-Radar bug reporting, the Confidential & Proprietary text on the lockscreen, as well as a few other small features. Please be careful with this script. This script is brand new and has not been tested on a variety of devices. It is *highly reccomended* that you create a backup before running this script in case anything is corrupted.
